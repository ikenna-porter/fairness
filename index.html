			This webpage focuses on the value of fairness and the role that it plays in my life. I believe this value is behind much of my conscious and subconscious decision making, and as such, I have decided to take a close look at the way it affects my worldview. Since every person’s life experiences vary and since everyone, at the end of the day, would like to think of themselves as being fair and just, I do not expect most to agree with my interpretation of what true societal and interpersonal fairness is. I do, however, hope that I will have conveyed my observations well enough to where most will, at the very least, understand the thought process behind my sense of justice. If not, then I may have even more thinking to do.

				<p class="material">
					On July 14, 1993, a young couple rushed to the hospital to begin what they believed to be the next chapter of their lives. The girl—distressed and afraid—was understandably agitated as the boy—jittery and also afraid—couldn’t help but blabber complete nonsense the whole day. Somewhere in between the boy’s wasted words, my sister and I were born. In that moment, it seemed to the young couple as if they truly had entered the next chapter of their lives; the one in which they settled down and raised a family together.
	 				<br><br>
					That belief, however, was short-lived, as they filed for divorce shortly after. The result was a fragmented family with an unjust distribution of responsibility. The young girl, just a few years shy of my own age, assumed responsibility and essentially embarked on that chapter alone.
	                <br><br>                                                      	
					Although the memories I have of my childhood are few and far between, looking back, I can’t help but appreciate my mom for single-handedly and even-handedly raising two children. Despite being raised in a less than ideal environment, not having finished college before our births, and working low-wage social service jobs throughout my childhood, she provided for the family on her own.
	 				<br><br>
					Not only that, but she managed to raise me and my sister equitably. When faced with a decision of whom should receive what--a conversation that occurred frequently given our class--she always approached the situation by weighing the outcome of previous decisions, as if keeping a mental tally of who received what last. Moreover, she would always explain her rationale for each decision she made. Her efforts to treat us justly can only stem from the unfair treatment she received as a child, which created a sense of justice that she practiced in her career and within her family. I have no doubt that the significance of fairness in my life stems from watching my mom weigh life’s decisions throughout my childhood.

			<h1 class="headerText">The Awakening</h1>
			<p class="material">
				After having spent my entire life in the same city, I was eager to escape, denounce everything I had come to learn, and start anew in my new home: Charlottesville, Virginia. However, as I soon came to realize upbringing plays a significant role in who you are and what you value. A lot of my college classmates, it seemed to me, could care less about generosity towards strangers or equality and fairness for all. Instead, their worldview seemed to focus almost exclusively on personal enrichment and social dominance, which completely contradicted the selflessness that my mom exemplified.
				<br><br>
				Moreover, by entering a new environment on my own I was forced to examine aspects of my identity--namely race and class--that I thought I understood completely. For the first time in my life, I truly understood what it meant to be black in America. After witnessing and experiencing unfair treatment from parts of the student body, I knew that I did not belong at my new home.
 				<br><br>
				As such, I tried to spend as much time away from campus as possible. I began volunteering at various social enterprises designed to serve the oppressed members of the Charlottesville community. As I volunteered, the amount of unfairness in American society became more and more clear.The back and forth between the opulence of my alma mater with its wealthy student body and the grimness of homeless shelters, orphanages, and refugee classes with their limited resources caused me to develop a greater sense of justice. These experiences awoke me to a previously untold reality.

			<h1 class="headerText">The Philosophy</h1>
			<p class="material">
				Due to the aforementioned observations and experiences, I have adopted a worldview that highlights the unfairness and injustices of society--especially as they pertain to racial, religious, ethnic, sexual, etc. minorities (i.e. the oppressed). Given previous and ongoing exploitations from the dominant class (i.e. the oppressors), the accumulation of wealth--which I believe to be the only tool that leads to true self-determination--is concentrated in hands of a select few. This can be seen globally between countries and locally within societies.
				<br><br>
				I believe creating a fair and just society is the only way to address the rising tension between the oppressors and the oppressed. This can only be achieved when the oppressors atone for the historical and continuous grievances of the oppressed, and when the oppressed begin viewing themselves as subjects capable of shaping the world around them. That is to say, equal access to opportunity will result in a just society...one in which the oppressors relinquish their monopoly on power, and the oppressed realize there are opportunities to be had by all.

			"The more radical the person is, the more fully he or she enters into reality so that, knowing it better, he or she can transform it. This individual is not afraid to confront, to listen, to see the world unveiled. This person is not afraid to meet the people or to enter into a dialogue with them. This person does not consider himself or herself the proprietor of history or of all people, or the liberator of the oppressed; but he or she does commit himself or herself, within history, to fight at their side."

			<h1 class="headerText">The Future</h1>
			<p class="material">
				Given the dominance of capitalism internationally, oppressed populations must strive for economic mobility, which is usually preceded by proper education, to increase their share of power. Fortunately, technology (the Internet, in particular) has proven its ability to provide unlimited access to unknown opportunities, traditional sources of education, and—most importantly—unorthodox ideologies. In fact, through constant exposure to different ideologies, the oppressed will naturally begin to challenge their original worldview by taking an active role in reshaping their reality—and ideally, the reality of their oppressed peers. This is why I want to learn web development. It’s a skill that empowers people to become creators on a platform that can truly reach the masses. 
				<br><br>
				In addition to providing the means by which I can reach this end, Founders and Coders also seems to be a cultural and ideological fit. Given my background and my current interpretation of the world, I am eager to work alongside people from around the world and Arab Israelis, a community facing its own share of disadvantages, so that I may continue to learn about humanity and the divisions within it. I strongly believe that participating in the next cohort will be a life-changing experience that will not only serve to strengthen my coding skills, but will also reinforce and alter my worldview.
				<br><br>
				Being a novice coder, I’m not sure what I will be able to offer to this cohort in terms of technical prowess. However, I do know that I will provide a unique perspective that will contribute to the educational experience of my perspective peers and instructors. Hopefully I conveyed that on this webpage.
